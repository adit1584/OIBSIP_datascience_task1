# Iris Flower Classification Using Machine Learning

## Description
The Iris Flower Classification project uses Machine Learning in Python to classify iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The classification is based on sepal and petal measurements. The model is trained on the Iris dataset to learn patterns and accurately predict the species of new flower samples.

## Dataset
The Iris dataset contains 150 records with four features:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

Each record belongs to one of the three iris species.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
